# Wavefront
Wavefront expansion algorithm is a specialized potential field path planner with breadth-first search, figuring the shortest path between the robot and the target, avoiding all the obstacles. It creates a growing circle around the robot, analyzes the nearest neighbors first, and then the radius of the circle is extended to distant regions until it reaches the desired location. 

A 3D graphical representation was developed using Processing, a graphical library. As well as the graphics, the algorithm was developed in Java.
